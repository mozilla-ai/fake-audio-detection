# **Results: Comparison with other methods & metrics**

Below you'll find our results with an SVM model trained on FOR_rerec and FOR_2sec datasets and tested on the InTheWild dataset ***(available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UncovAI/InTheWild))***. We can compare these results to those from the paper [MLAAD: The Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09512).

### Model Performance Comparison: All Models Trained on Identical Datasets
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| **Our SVM** | **68.9%** |
| SLL W2V2 | 57.8% |
| Whisper DF | 54.1%|
| RAWGAT-ST | 49.8% |

**Performance Gain:** Our SVM model shows an improvement of at least 11% compared to the best model (SLL W2V2) reported in the [MLAAD paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09512).
